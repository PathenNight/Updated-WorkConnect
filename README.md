Make sure to look at the Frontend files, Backend files, and Frontend Public files 
to make sure the folders are setup properly.

Also, there is a second package.json and package-lock.json that I have for the backend that keep replacing the ones
already uploaded so Ill try to figure out how to upload those separately in the morning.
